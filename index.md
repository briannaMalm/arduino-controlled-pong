# Final Milestone
My final milestone is the increased reliability and accuracy of my robot. I ameliorated the sagging and fixed the reliability of the finger. As discussed in my second milestone, the arm sags because of weight. I put in a block of wood at the base to hold up the upper arm; this has reverberating positive effects throughout the arm. I also realized that the forearm was getting disconnected from the elbow servo’s horn because of the weight stress on the joint. Now, I make sure to constantly tighten the screws at that joint.

# First Milestone
  

My first milestone was getting my processing software working and making the ball move and stay on the screen.I had issues at the beginning of inserting the code because it was just moving in two directions and it needed to be different directions.Then once it was in different directions it didn't want to stay on the screen.It disappeared once the game started.However I was able to fix this issue.After I had gotten paddles on the screen, it was starting to look more like a pong game.However, the ball wasn't affected by the paddles.It seemed to pass right through the padlles.However,the paddles needed to have the ability to stop the ball's movement.After a few adjustments ,it  sucessfully bounced of the paddles and became and effective pong game.
